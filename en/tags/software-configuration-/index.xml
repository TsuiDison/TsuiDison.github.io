      <description>&lt;p&gt;What this paper wants to talk about is not only the simple configuration of $\LaTeX$in vscode. After two years&amp;rsquo; accumulation of writing $\LaTeX$, I found that &amp;ldquo;proficient in $\LaTeX$&amp;rdquo; is not only able to memorize some common codes, but more importantly, to make good use of various related software, plug-ins and websites, so as to make my writing and typesetting more efficient.&#xA;However, tools are not the more the better, if a tool can achieve a variety of functions, it is actually redundant to install an additional software, I always think that in the case of similar functions to choose a plug-in is better than the use of the website, the next is to download an additional software.&#xA;What I want to talk about below are some tools for making writing $\LaTeX$more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
